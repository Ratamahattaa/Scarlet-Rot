## Project Description

Scarlet Rot is a visual simulation of infection spreading, inspired by the Scarlet Rot mechanic from the game Elden Ring. The project presents a grid of tiles where the "rot" spreads organically, changing tile colors and generating dynamic visual effects such as cracks and floating particles.

The goal of the project is to combine simple grid-based mechanics with graphical effects based on animations and mathematical functions (e.g., sinusoidal functions), creating a natural and aesthetic visual experience. The interactive design allows users to start the infection anywhere on the grid with a click, as well as reset the simulation at any time.

## Features

- **Interactive 25x25 grid** where each cell can change its infection state.
- Three stages of infection: fresh infection, advanced infection, and dead tiles.
- Visual effects:
  - Animated particles floating over infected tiles.
  - Dynamic cracks pulsating with sinusoidal motion.
- Infection progress displayed as a percentage of affected tiles.
- Ability to reset the simulation with a single click.

## Technologies

- **JavaScript** — simulation logic and animations.
- **HTML5 Canvas** — rendering the grid and visual effects.
- **CSS** — interface styling with a dark, atmospheric theme.

## How to Use

1. Click anywhere on the grid to start the infection.
2. Watch as the rot spreads organically.
3. Click "Cleanse Rot" to reset the simulation.
